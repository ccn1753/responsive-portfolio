        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Czzg1H9.jpg" alt="Crista" style="width:200px;height:200px;">
        <p>My name is Crista. I enjoy people watching. I love meeting new people and getting to know them and their
        thought process. When I was in grade school, I took a career test and it said I would be best fit in human
        services career, because of my love for humanity. I even attended some college and studied Sociology, continuing
        on that people path. But, I spent most of my life dedicated to people, I don't really know who I am. My hobbies
        and habits are aquired from friends, family members, and coworkers. There's nothing wrong with that, but I find
        myself always disclaiming any cool points for it being my original idea. This isn't a "woe is me" plea. This is
        my reason for attending a web developing bootcamp. Sure, my only background in html and css was designing my
        Xanga and Myspace pages, but Facebook took that away from me, so now I'm taking it back! This is who I want to
        become for me. Thanks for reading!</p>
